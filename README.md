**Bonjou** (derived from *Bonjour*, French for *Hello*) is a fast, lightweight terminal application that lets you instantly chat and share files with anyone on your local network (WiFi/LAN). 

No servers to configure. No internet connection required. No accounts to create. Just open your terminal and start typing.

## ✨ Why Bonjou?

- 🔌 **Zero Config:** Auto-discovers users on your subnet via UDP.
- 🗂️ **Seamless File Transfers:** Send files and entire directories over TCP.
- 🔒 **Secure-by-Design:** Metadata-first approval queue means no files are written to your machine without your explicit permission.
- 💻 **Cross-Platform:** Works flawlessly across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- 🪄 **Interactive TUI:** Built on the beautiful [Charmbracelet](https://charm.sh/) stack. Features a guided `@wizard` mode if you prefer menus over commands.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Security

Bonjou is designed to be trustless and secure on local networks.

*   **Discovery Engine:** Peers are discovered using UDP broadcast on port `46320`. (Note: This generally does not cross routers/VLANs).
*   **Transfer Protocol:** Messages and files are transmitted via TCP on port `46321`.
*   **Metadata-First Transfers:** When a peer sends you a file, you receive a manifest preview first. The actual payload is only transferred over TCP *after* you explicitly run `@approve <id>`.
*   **Storage Locations:**
    * Approved files: `~/.bonjou/received/files/`
    * Approved folders: `~/.bonjou/received/folders/`
    * Pinned peer keys: `~/.bonjou/known_peers.json`
    * Config & State: `~/.bonjou/config.json`

### Encryption (protocol v2)

Bonjou now uses an authenticated, length-prefixed wire format with strong
defaults. The full design and threat model is in
[`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md); the headlines:

*   **AES-256-GCM** authenticated encryption for every envelope, with the
    wire-format version bound as additional authenticated data so a downgrade
    attack is rejected at decryption time.
*   **Chunked AES-GCM** for file and folder payloads — each chunk has its own
    16-byte GCM tag, so tampering is detected mid-transfer rather than only
    at the end via a plaintext checksum.
*   **HKDF-derived per-purpose keys** (`Kenc`, `Kmac`, and a per-stream
    subkey) so encryption and authentication never share keying material,
    and nonce reuse across streams is structurally impossible.
*   **Trust-on-first-use (TOFU)** for peer identities: the first
    announcement under each username pins that peer's X25519 public key
    into `~/.bonjou/known_peers.json`. Subsequent announcements with a
    different key are rejected and logged.
*   **Replay rejection** via a per-peer nonce cache and a timestamp
    freshness window (10 minutes past, 1 minute future).
*   **Incoming size cap** (`max_incoming_bytes`, default 16 GiB) so a
    malicious sender cannot make the receive loop read forever.
*   **Setpath safeguards**: `@setpath` refuses system roots and warns when
    the destination is outside the user's home directory.

Operators can verify pinning with `@known` and `@fingerprint`, and recover
from legitimate key rotations with `@trust` / `@forget`.

What v2 does **not** yet provide (tracked in
[`docs/security-model.md`](docs/security-model.md)):

*   **Forward secrecy** — the long-term key derived from
    `~/.bonjou/config.json` is reused across sessions. A future release
    will introduce ephemeral DH per connection (Noise-style).
*   **OS keychain integration** — the secret is still on disk at mode
    0600; a `SecretStore` abstraction is in place for that work.
*   **At-rest chat encryption** — `~/.bonjou/logs/chat.log` is plaintext.
